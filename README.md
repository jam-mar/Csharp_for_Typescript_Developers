## About This Course

This comprehensive course is designed to help JavaScript, TypeScript, and Node.js developers transition to the C# and .NET ecosystem. The course combines theoretical learning with practical application through a real-world project implementation.

## Linked Project Repository

This course content is directly linked to a **full-stack share trading application** built with C#, .NET, ASP.NET Core, and React. The project is a comprehensive trading platform that allows users to pull real-time market data, analyze stock performance, execute trades, and manage their investment portfolios.

### How the Repositories Work Together

- **Course Modules** â†’ **Project Implementation**: Each course concept is demonstrated through real code in the woodworking project
- **Branch-Based Learning**: Specific project branches correspond to course modules
- **Commit References**: Key commits in the project repo illustrate course concepts in action
- **Progressive Development**: Follow along as both the course content and project evolve together

This approach gives you both the theory and practical application side by side - learn a C# concept here, then see it implemented in a production-quality project.

## Course Structure

The course covers:

- Transitioning from JavaScript/TypeScript mental models to C#
- Understanding .NET ecosystem and tooling
- ASP.NET Core for web development
- Real-world patterns and best practices
- Enterprise development approaches

## Target Audience

- JavaScript developers looking to expand into enterprise development
- TypeScript developers wanting to leverage static typing in a compiled language
- Node.js developers interested in .NET for backend development
- Full-stack developers exploring C# for web applications

## Contributions

Contributions are very welcome! I'm learning as I go, so there will no doubt be errors. Please don't hesitate to put in a pull request to correct anything I've got wrong :)

### How to Contribute

- **Course Content**: Fix errors, improve explanations, add examples
- **Project Integration**: Suggest better ways to connect course concepts with project implementation
- **Additional Resources**: Add helpful links, tools, or references
- **Feedback**: Open issues for suggestions or questions

## Getting Started

1. Start with the [Course](https://jam-mar.github.io/js-to-csharp-crash-course/)
2. Follow along with the [Woodworking Project](https://github.com/jam-mar/woodworking-planner) _(coming soon)_
3. Check out specific branches mentioned in course modules
4. Experiment with the code and concepts

## Stay Updated
