# Getting Started with C# for JavaScript/TypeScript Developers

Welcome to your journey from JavaScript/TypeScript to C#! This chapter introduces you to the C# world by building on concepts you already know from web development.

## Chapter Overview

This foundational chapter provides a comprehensive overview of C# for developers coming from JavaScript and TypeScript backgrounds. It covers the essential concepts, syntax comparisons, and mental shifts you'll need to make the transition successfully.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this chapter, you'll be able to:

- **Understand C# fundamentals** - How C# differs from and relates to JavaScript/TypeScript
- **Navigate syntax differences** - Compare familiar JS/TS patterns with their C# equivalents
- **Grasp the .NET ecosystem** - Understand the platform's multi-paradigm approach and capabilities
- **Identify key mental shifts** - Know what conceptual changes to expect in your development approach

## Current Lesson

### 1. [From JavaScript/TypeScript to C#: A Developer's Migration Guide](00-introduction)

_15 minutes_

Complete migration guide covering C-type languages, syntax comparisons, lambda expressions, LINQ equivalents to JavaScript array methods, and the mental shifts needed to transition from dynamic to statically-typed development.

## Coming Soon

**More chapters with hands-on exercises are coming soon!** This course will expand to include:

- **Environment Setup** - Step-by-step .NET SDK installation and tooling setup
- **Language Fundamentals** - Deep dive into C#'s type system and core features
- **Object-Oriented Programming** - Classes, inheritance, and polymorphism in C#
- **Functional Programming** - LINQ, pattern matching, and functional concepts
- **ASP.NET Core** - Building web APIs and applications
- **Testing and Debugging** - Unit testing and debugging techniques
- **Practical Projects** - Real-world applications to solidify your learning

## Prerequisites

No specific prerequisites! This course assumes you have JavaScript or TypeScript experience and are ready to learn C#.

## Time Commitment

**Current estimated time:** {{ page.estimated_time }} minutes

Additional chapters will add more content and hands-on exercises to reinforce your learning.

## Getting Help

If you have questions about the current content:

1. **Review the comprehensive syntax comparisons** in the migration guide
2. **Check the reference links** provided throughout the lesson
3. **Refer to the official Microsoft documentation** linked in each section

## Next Steps

After reading the migration guide, you'll have a solid foundation for understanding C#'s relationship to JavaScript and TypeScript. Stay tuned for upcoming chapters that will provide hands-on experience and deeper exploration of C# development!
