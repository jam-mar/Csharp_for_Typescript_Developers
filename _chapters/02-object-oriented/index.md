# Object-Oriented Programming in C#

Welcome to the heart of C# programming! While JavaScript has classes and TypeScript adds type annotations, C# offers a complete, mature object-oriented programming system that's been refined over decades.

## Chapter Overview

This chapter transforms you from writing procedural code to thinking in objects. You'll learn how to model real-world problems using classes, inheritance, and interfaces - concepts that are more powerful in C# than their JavaScript/TypeScript counterparts.

## Why This Chapter Matters

Object-oriented programming in C# isn't just about syntax - it's about:

- **Code Organization** - Structure large applications effectively
- **Code Reuse** - Inheritance and composition patterns
- **Maintainability** - Encapsulation and separation of concerns
- **Flexibility** - Interfaces and polymorphism for extensible designs
- **Team Development** - Clear contracts and boundaries between components

## JavaScript/TypeScript vs C# OOP

| Concept              | JavaScript/TypeScript         | C#                                      |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Classes**          | ES6 classes, prototypes       | Full class system with access modifiers |
| **Inheritance**      | Single inheritance            | Single inheritance + interfaces         |
| **Encapsulation**    | Convention-based (`_private`) | Language-enforced (private, protected)  |
| **Polymorphism**     | Duck typing                   | Interface-based and inheritance-based   |
| **Static Members**   | Static methods/properties     | Static classes, methods, properties     |
| **Abstract Classes** | Not supported                 | Full abstract class support             |

{{ exercise.description }}

{% endfor %}

## Key Concepts You'll Master

### Core OOP Principles

- **Encapsulation** - Hide implementation details behind clean interfaces
- **Inheritance** - Build on existing functionality without duplication
- **Polymorphism** - Write code that works with multiple types
- **Abstraction** - Focus on what objects do, not how they do it

### C#-Specific Features

- **Properties** - Smart fields with getter/setter logic
- **Access Modifiers** - Precise control over member visibility
- **Virtual Methods** - Opt-in polymorphism for performance
- **Sealed Classes** - Prevent unwanted inheritance
- **Extension Methods** - Add functionality to existing types

## Real-World Applications

This chapter's concepts apply directly to:

- **Web API Development** - Controller classes, service layers
- **Domain Modeling** - Business entities and their relationships
- **Design Patterns** - Factory, Strategy, Observer patterns
- **Framework Usage** - Understanding .NET's object model
- **Testing** - Mocking interfaces and dependency injection

## Time Commitment

**Total estimated time:** {{ page.estimated_time }} minutes ({{ page.estimated_time | divided_by: 60.0 | round: 1 }} hours)

This is a substantial chapter because OOP is central to effective C# development. Take your time with the exercises!
