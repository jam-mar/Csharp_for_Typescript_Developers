# Language Fundamentals

Now that you have C# set up and running, let's dive into the core language features that make C# different from JavaScript and TypeScript.

## Chapter Overview

This chapter focuses on the fundamental building blocks of C# programming. You'll learn how C#'s static type system provides both safety and performance benefits, and how to leverage these features effectively.

## What Makes This Chapter Important

Coming from JavaScript's dynamic typing or TypeScript's optional typing, C#'s mandatory static typing might seem restrictive at first. However, you'll discover how this constraint actually enables:

- **Compile-time error detection** - Catch bugs before they reach production
- **Better IDE support** - IntelliSense that actually knows what you're working with
- **Performance optimization** - The compiler can make assumptions about your code
- **Self-documenting code** - Method signatures tell you exactly what they expect

## Key Concepts You'll Master

- **Static vs Dynamic Typing** - Why C# catches errors at compile time
- **Value Types vs Reference Types** - Memory allocation and performance implications
- **Nullable Types** - Handling null safely in a strongly-typed world
- **Method Overloading** - Same name, different parameters
- **Pattern Matching** - Modern C# features for cleaner conditional logic

## JavaScript/TypeScript Developers: Pay Special Attention To

1. **No `undefined`** - C# only has `null`, and it's strictly controlled
2. **Explicit type declarations** - No `let` or `var` without types in most cases
3. **Method signatures matter** - Overloading based on parameter types
4. **Value type behavior** - Structs behave differently than objects
5. **Compilation requirements** - Code must be valid before it runs
